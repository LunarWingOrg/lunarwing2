# LunarWing Introduction

## Claws are overrated. So, grow your wings and fly...

### Secure, privacy-focused AI agents you can self-host.

LunarWing is an agentic software framework built in Rust. It connects AI agents to privacy-respecting communication layers — IRC, DarkIRC, XMPP with OMEMO, and more — with real secret management baked in from the start.

It's a hard fork of NearAI's IronClaw, diverging significantly since February 2026. LunarWing is not affiliated with NearAI.

## Why LunarWing

- **Self-hostable end to end** — runs entirely on your own infrastructure, no third-party dependencies required.
- **Privacy-first channels** — XMPP/OMEMO, WeeChat relay, and DarkIRC (opt-in as of v1.1.8). No Slack, Discord, or Telegram — by design.
- **WASM plugin system** — extend agents with tools and channel adapters compiled to WebAssembly.
- **Built-in secret management** — specialized wrappers for Postgres and LibSQL credential handling.
- **Self-healing infrastructure** — advanced healthchecks and automatic recovery for LunarWing, channel bridges, adapters, daemons, and even scheduled routines.
- **TensorZero integration** — Native TensorZero model routing support for local and remote providers. (The optional custom HTTP proxy was removed in v1.1.9; use a standalone TensorZero gateway instead.)
- **Lunarpunk values** — AGPLv3 forever. Free software, free infrastructure, no compromises.

##### End of Introduction

# Finer Details

The LunarWing project began in February 2026. Initially a hard fork of the Ironclaw project to support custom tools and channels, the project eventually evolved to introduce deep infrastructural changes over time.

LunarWing is a self-hosted, privacy-first AI agent. The fork prioritizes useful tools, bridges, and channels such as XMPP/OMEMO, Gotify, scheduled routines with fallbacks, systemd deployment, OpenRC, and open-protocol channels. Proprietary service centered channels (Slack, Discord, Telegram) are intentionally unsupported within the monorepo and are gradually being fully removed.

The LunarWing project strictly maintains the AGPLv3 license on the core project and all extensions, tools, and channels. We will use the same license across our other repositories if legally possible.

## Why "LunarWing"?

**Lunar** -- We are firm believers in Lunarpunk.

**Wing** -- Wings are extensions of the body which allow flight. We chose the term `wing` to differentiate ourselves from most open source agentic software which uses the term `claw`. We are not required to remain on the ground.

## Features

LunarWing adds real privacy-respecting tools and channels, with full secret support, right out of the box:

### Channels & Communication
* **XMPP with OMEMO** -- WASM channel, bridge service, and core code changes for full encrypted chat (1:1 and group), with XEP-0363 HTTP file upload support
* **Weechat** -- WASM channel allowing the agent to use Weechat as an IRC/DarkIRC/Signal/XMPP/Slack/Matrix/Rocketchat client
* **Enjin** -- optional weechat plugin to enable E2E for normal IRC
* **DarkIRC** -- DarkIRC WASM channel, p2p e2e protocol from DarkFi. **As of v1.1.8, DarkIRC is hard-disabled by default** — services are not created and the binary is not built unless explicitly opted in via `--enable-darkirc` (on `add-tenant`/`start-tenant`) and `build-darkirc`. Existing tenants are unaffected until their units are re-rendered.

### Tools & Notifications
* **Gotify** -- WASM tool for agent-initiated push notifications
* **LunarVision (Vision Service / OCR Sidecar)** -- Standalone Rust service for OCR (Tesseract) and vision-language analysis (Qwen3-VL), with smart routing, PaddleOCR fallback, disk-backed cache persistence, an API-versioned HTTP surface with an OpenAPI spec, and a self-reported `/health` endpoint. Runs rootless under Podman (`projects/ocr-sidecar/`)
* **vision-analyze WASM Tool** -- Native WASM tool for image analysis via the LunarVision sidecar; rewritten from scratch in v1.1.7 and re-registered with the WASM toolset (`ic/tools-src/vision-analyze/`)
* **Lunartica** -- Free Open Source Self Hostable Agent Coordination Platform (separate repo)

### Worker Containers
* **Nanocode Worker** -- Persistent NanoGPT community Nanocode worker container with optional ACP bridge, git/ssh key support, persistent storage, and development tools (`lunarcode4lunarwing/`)
* **Pebble Worker** -- Persistent Rust-based Pebble agentic coding harness worker with NDJSON event streaming and health endpoints (`pebble4lunarwing/`)
* **Opencode Worker** -- Persistent [opencode](https://opencode.ai) (sst/opencode) worker container speaking the `lunarwing-agent-v1` WebSocket protocol (legacy alias `ironclaw-agent-v1` still accepted), with the `@opencode-ai/sdk`, optional Paseo MCP integration, git/ssh key support, and health endpoints (`opencode4lunarwing/`)
* **Reworked Built-in Worker - Debloated** -- Native worker running inside the LunarWing daemon getting debloated, rip out obsolete worker modes in favor of specialized worker container support (`ic/src/worker/`)
* **Reworked Sandbox Worker - Debloated** -- Docker-isolated execution sandbox, debloated (`ic/src/sandbox/`)

### Infrastructure & Operations
* **Agent SSH Harness** (introduced v1.1.7, tooling completed v1.1.8) -- A centralized, per-tenant SSH bridge that lets worker containers authenticate to a host over SSH **without the private key ever touching disk** inside the container (or on the host outside the encrypted secrets store). Key material lives AES-256-GCM-encrypted in the secrets store and is served to workers over a per-tenant `ssh-agent` Unix socket; the agent signs challenges in memory. Host-key verification is fail-closed. **v1.1.8 added the consuming tools:** a built-in in-process Rust `ssh` tool (delivery Option 2), a `ssh_git` tool for git-over-SSH through the harness, and a WASM `ssh` guest tool (delivery Option 3). `start-tenant` now uploads the staged key, bounces the daemon once to load it, and starts workers after the socket is real. Enabled by default for new tenants; configurable via `configure-ssh` and the `[ssh]` section of `config.toml`. Live-validated on systemd and OpenRC.
* Specialized secret management wrapper scripts for both PostgreSQL and libSQL
* Optional systemd, launchd, and OpenRC services for LunarWing, channel bridges, and healthcheck services
* Improved scheduling system with native retry and exponential backoff for transient failures, stuck-run recovery, configurable lightweight execution timeouts, and automatic sweeping of orphaned routine runs
* Self-healing healthchecks for channel bridge services, the daemon, and the routines system. Infrastructure health checks auto-detect init system (systemd, OpenRC, launchd)
* Production multi-tenant deployment via `scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` with per-user OS isolation, port registry (v11 schema — dedicated per-tenant ports for workers, DarkIRC, and the LunarVision sidecar), and support for systemd, macOS (launchd), and OpenRC
* TensorZero model routing support (the optional custom HTTP proxy was removed in v1.1.9; use a standalone TensorZero gateway)
* Support for embedded memory search models
* Reflex compiler for LLM-free fast-path execution of recurring prompts with exact, fuzzy (Jaro-Winkler), and semantic matching, auto-promotion, and stale pattern eviction
* Supervised mode (`--supervised`) for human-gated tool execution — all tool actions require explicit approval regardless of tier
* Response suppression and future cancellation with soft timeout and secondary hard-kill mechanism

### Development & Testing
* Automated test suite with trace-replay E2E testing (no real LLM required)
* Worker test harness for all worker types with Docker Compose isolation (`tests/`)
* REPLv2 server and client with better output formatting and subagent support, backout and approval support included
* Support for external agentic coding tools via external worker mode
* Cross-platform test harness (`lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh`) with launchd (macOS), systemd (Linux), and OpenRC support as well as a production-grade developer testing suite

### Philosophy

LunarWing developers care about your freedom as a user. We do not support proprietary platforms in our official repository. All WASM tools and channels that developers wish to create for proprietary platforms can be maintained elsewhere. We focus on self-hostable communication layers and open protocols.

The LunarWing core development team is not affiliated with NearAI.

Our core team uses a self-hosted Vikunja kanban board to track tasks. Additionally, we use our own LunarWing agents to keep track of project progress.

#### As of now, we are entirely self-funded and work on this project on a voluntary basis. No VCs, Corporate Overlords, or sponsorships/grants. This will be updated in the future if it changes.

## Instance Setup

The primary deployment model is **multi-tenant production** — each tenant is a real OS user with its own home, repo clone, release build, rootless Podman container store, per-tenant PostgreSQL, per-tenant secrets, a 10-port block, and per-tenant systemd (or OpenRC) service units.

As of v1.1.9, the recommended way to get started is the **`lunarwing_mt_onboard` interactive CLI** (the "MT Admin CLI wrapper"), which automates the full provisioning lifecycle end to end. Under the hood it wraps `ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh`, which remains the source of truth and is available directly for operators who need full control over every flag.

### Getting Started: MT Admin CLI Wrapper (`lunarwing_mt_onboard`)

The `lunarwing_mt_onboard` CLI (new in v1.1.9) walks an operator through the full tenant provisioning lifecycle: tenant identity, port allocation, secrets generation, LLM and channel configuration, external worker selection, build, and start/verify. It is a thin interactive wrapper around `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` — it does not duplicate provisioning logic.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, `rich` and `questionary` (see `requirements.txt`), root/sudo.

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r lunarwing_mt_onboard/requirements.txt
```

**Interactive provisioning (recommended for first-time setup):**

```bash
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard
```

This launches a guided session that collects all tenant configuration (name, LLM provider/model, XMPP, Gotify, workers, SSH, health checks), then runs `add-tenant` → `build-tenant` → `start-tenant` with live log output and post-start verification.

**Resume a saved session:**

```bash
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard --resume /path/to/tenant.json
```

**Non-interactive (CI / bulk provisioning):**

```bash
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard \
  --non-interactive \
  --resume tenant.json \
  --save result.json
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--non-interactive` | Skip all prompts; requires `--resume` |
| `--accept-defaults` | Accept default values for any unspecified fields |
| `--resume FILE` | Load a previously saved `TenantConfig` JSON |
| `--save FILE` | Save the collected config to JSON before provisioning |
| `--skip-build` | Only run `add-tenant` |
| `--skip-start` | Run `add-tenant` + `build-tenant`, skip `start-tenant` |

**In-place tenant upgrade:**

The `upgrade` subcommand wraps `upgrade-preflight.sh` and `upgrade-tenant-version.sh` for same-host version bumps of existing tenants. Dry-run by default.

```bash
# Interactive dry-run
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard upgrade

# Non-interactive dry-run
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard upgrade \
  --tenant ruffles \
  --target v1.1.9 \
  --non-interactive

# Apply the upgrade
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard upgrade \
  --tenant ruffles \
  --target v1.1.9 \
  --apply \
  --yes \
  --non-interactive
```

**Kawarimi tenant export (cross-host migration):**

The `export` subcommand wraps `export-tenant.sh` for cross-host migration. Dry-run by default.

```bash
# Interactive dry-run
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard export

# Apply (stops tenant and writes bundle)
sudo python3 -m lunarwing_mt_onboard export \
  --tenant ruffles \
  --apply \
  --non-interactive
```

See [lunarwing_mt_onboard/README.md](lunarwing_mt_onboard/README.md) for the full CLI reference, configuration file format, and module layout.

### Manual Multi-Tenant Path (`lunarwing-mt-admin.sh`)

For operators who need direct control over every flag, `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` is the underlying provisioning tool. Full walkthrough: [docs/guides/MT-ADMIN-QUICKSTART.md](docs/guides/MT-ADMIN-QUICKSTART.md). Production reference: [docs/ops/MULTITENANCY-PRODUCTION.md](docs/ops/MULTITENANCY-PRODUCTION.md).

Prerequisites: root/sudo, Docker **or** Podman, `jq`, `git`. No host Rust toolchain needed — `add-tenant` installs a per-tenant rustup toolchain with WASM targets.

```bash
# 1. Check dependencies
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh doctor

# 2. Provision a tenant (creates OS user, allocates ports, clones repo,
#    writes env files, starts per-tenant PostgreSQL, renders service units)
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh add-tenant ruffles --docker-group

# 3. Build the tenant's release binary (+ WASM tools)
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh build-tenant ruffles --with-wasm
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh install-wasm ruffles

# 4. Start it
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh start-tenant ruffles

# 5. Inspect
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh status ruffles     # service + container health
sudo ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh tokens ruffles     # gateway auth token, ports, etc.
```

The gateway binds `127.0.0.1` by default; for remote access, tunnel the HTTP port over SSH (e.g. `ssh -L 10000:127.0.0.1:10000 user@host`, then open `http://localhost:10000`). Batch provisioning is supported: `add-tenants "Ruffles,Miyuki,Sparkie" --docker-group` then `build-all --with-wasm` / `install-wasm-all`.

Additional worker containers (nanocode, pebble, opencode) can be attached at build time with `--with-nanocode` / `--with-pebble` / `--with-opencode`. DarkIRC is opt-in (`--enable-darkirc` + `build-darkirc`). See the quickstart for the full flag reference.

### Local single-instance (unmaintained)

For quick local testing without multi-tenant isolation, build the release binary and let the onboarding wizard configure everything. On first run with no database configured, `lunarwing run` auto-triggers **quick onboarding**, which defaults every non-LLM choice (embedded libSQL at `~/.lunarwing/lunarwing.db`, keychain-or-env secrets) and only prompts for the inference provider and model.

> **Note:** This path is not actively maintained and may not work reliably. The multi-tenant CLI above is the supported path.

```bash
cd ic
cargo build --release
./target/release/lunarwing run          # auto-triggers quick onboarding on first run
# or explicitly:
./target/release/lunarwing onboard --quick
```

`ic/run.sh` wraps the release binary with sane dev defaults (`HTTP_PORT=9098`, `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=1`, `PGSSLMODE=disable`, `AGENT_NAME=lunarwing`, 2s start delay):

```bash
cd ic
LUNARWING_BASE_DIR=/path/to/instance ./run.sh
```

### Preseeding persona files (optional)

You can give an agent a custom identity and memories *before* its first interaction. Workspace files are imported from `$LUNARWING_BASE_DIR/workspace-template/` at runtime. Copy persona files (`SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`) from [ic/deploy/workspace-template/](ic/deploy/workspace-template/) into that directory, customize them, then run onboarding.

### Config defaults

The shipped runtime config template is [ic/deploy/config.toml](ic/deploy/config.toml). Defaults: `llm_backend = "openai_compatible"`, `selected_model = "tensorzero::function_name::lunarwing"`, `agent.name = "lunarwing"`, `openai_compatible_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/openai/v1"`. Override any of these via env vars or `config.toml` for your environment.

`SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` (a 64-char hex value) enables the encrypted secrets store without depending on the OS keychain. On Linux, `lunarwing onboard --quick` generates and persists this automatically when missing; in multi-tenant setups `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` provisions it per tenant.

## Upgrading & Migration

LunarWing ships dedicated tooling for two distinct operations, both driven by `ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` and documented under `docs/ops/`:

- **Same-host version upgrade** — bump an existing tenant from an older LunarWing release to a newer one in place. The general-purpose upgrader is `ic/scripts/upgrade-tenant-version.sh` (PostgreSQL, rootful Docker; supports `--target <version>` and a read-only dry-run by default, `--apply` to execute). A readiness preflight is available via `ic/scripts/upgrade-preflight.sh`. See `docs/ops/MT-LEGACY-UPGRADE-NOTES.md` for the full runbook and gates.

- **Cross-host migration (Kawarimi)** — move a tenant to a different host while leaving the old one as a rollback standby. The flow is `export-tenant.sh <tenant>` on the source (produces a `0600` bundle: `pg_dump`, env manifests, OMEMO store + workspace) → `import-tenant.sh <bundle.tar>` on the target. **PostgreSQL-only**; libSQL tenants are refused. This is a cutover with per-tenant downtime. See `docs/guides/MIGRATE_IRONCLAW_TO_LUNARWING.md` and `docs/ops/MT-MACHINE-MIGRATION.md`.

Both paths are **hardened but should be rehearsed** against a non-production tenant before being trusted on live data. Always back up first (`mt-admin.sh backup-tenant <name>`).

## Testing

### Rust Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
cd ic
cargo test                          # unit tests
cargo test --features integration   # + PostgreSQL tests
cargo test test_name -- --nocapture # single test with output
```

### E2E Tests (Python/Playwright)

Browser-based E2E tests against a live instance with a mock LLM. See [ic/tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md](ic/tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md).

```bash
cd ic/tests/e2e
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium
pytest scenarios/
```

### Worker Test Harness

Matrix test suite for all external worker types (nanocode, pebble, opencode), plus the built-in and sandbox workers. Validates health endpoints, WebSocket protocol, error handling, and resource cleanup.

```bash
cd tests
pip install -r requirements.txt
python runner.py --mode smoke     # happy paths only (CI)
python runner.py --mode full      # + chaos scenarios (nightly)
python runner.py --worker nanocode   # single worker type
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for the full test matrix and mock service architecture.

### Integration Test Harness

`ic/scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh` is the full-stack test harness for PostgreSQL, TensorZero proxy, XMPP bridge, WASM artifacts, and the daemon. Works on Linux and macOS.

- Single-tenant quick start: see [docs/ops/HARNESS-SINGLE-TENANT.md](docs/ops/HARNESS-SINGLE-TENANT.md)
- Multi-tenant quick start: see [docs/ops/MULTITENANCY-HARNESS.md](docs/ops/MULTITENANCY-HARNESS.md)
- Full single-tenant reference: [ic/testing/lunarwing-xmpp/README.md](ic/testing/lunarwing-xmpp/README.md)

## Watchdog Scheduler

```bash
sudo ic/scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
```

Behavior depends on the detected service manager:

- **systemd**: installs `lunarwing-watchdog.service` + `lunarwing-watchdog.timer`
- **OpenRC**: installs `lunarwing-watchdog-openrc` + either an hourly hook or a managed root `fcrontab` entry

The OpenRC default is intentionally conservative:
- If `cronie`, `crond`, or `dcron` is already present, the installer keeps the cron-hourly path
- If no cron daemon is present but `fcron` is available, the installer uses `fcron` automatically

Force a specific OpenRC mode:

```bash
sudo LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_SCHEDULER=fcron ic/scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
sudo LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_SCHEDULER=hourly ic/scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
```

Use `LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_CRON_DIR=/path/to/hourly-dir` for nonstandard directory layouts.
