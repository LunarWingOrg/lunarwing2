# LunarWing and XMPP Bridge Testing

This guide sets up an isolated local environment for LunarWing. The binary,
socket file, and service names now use `lunarwing`; the legacy `IRONCLAW_*`
environment variables are still accepted as aliases for backward compatibility.

The goal is to test in layers:

1. Build the LunarWing and bridge binaries.
2. Smoke-test the local bridge HTTP API and bearer-token enforcement.
3. Configure the bridge against a live XMPP account when needed.
4. Run LunarWing and the bridge under either the script harness or user systemd.

## Quick Start

From the repo's `ic/` directory:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh init
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh build
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh smoke
```

`scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh build` also compiles the real REPLv2
client with `cargo build --release` from:

- `<repo-root>/replv2git/git-lunarwing-unix-socket-client-repo`

When you source the generated harness env file, both the integrated CLI and the
standalone REPLv2 client target the harness-specific Unix socket under
`$LUNARWING_TEST_ROOT/run/lunarwing.sock` instead of the shared
`/run/user/$UID/lunarwing.sock`.

For convenience, the harness script can launch the standalone client directly:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh repl
```

For a command-by-command setup walkthrough, see
[`testing/lunarwing-xmpp/README.md`](../testing/lunarwing-xmpp/README.md).
That guide now also includes copy-paste "Fresh Recreate Recipes" for both the
Postgres-backed user-systemd harness and the separate libSQL bootstrap path.

The default test root is `/tmp/lunarwing-xmpp-test`. Export an override when
you want the state to survive reboots:

```bash
export LUNARWING_TEST_ROOT="$HOME/.local/state/lunarwing-xmpp-test"
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh init
```

Generated files:

- `env/lunarwing.env` for the LunarWing daemon.
- `env/xmpp-bridge.env` for the XMPP bridge.
- `state/` for the isolated `LUNARWING_BASE_DIR` (legacy alias
  `IRONCLAW_BASE_DIR`), libSQL database, and OMEMO store.
- `logs/` and `run/` for harness-managed processes.
- `systemd/` for generated user-service unit files.

The env files are created with mode `0600`. They may contain live XMPP passwords
and bridge tokens, so do not paste their contents into chat, issues, or logs.

The generated `env/lunarwing.env` is already seeded for the common private-lab
stack used by this harness:

- `LUNARWING_SOCKET=$LUNARWING_TEST_ROOT/run/lunarwing.sock`
- `IRONCLAW_SOCKET=$LUNARWING_TEST_ROOT/run/lunarwing.sock` (legacy alias, set
  alongside the new name)
- `DATABASE_BACKEND=postgres`
- `DATABASE_SSLMODE=disable`
- `PGSSLMODE=disable`
- `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=1`
- `LLM_BACKEND=openai_compatible`
- `LLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002/openai/v1`
- `LLM_MODEL=tensorzero::function_name::ironclaw`
- `WASM_CHANNELS_ENABLED=true`

Do not remove those defaults unless you are intentionally changing the test
network, database SSL mode, or provider path.

## Bridge API Smoke Tests

The bridge can start without live XMPP credentials. This is useful for testing
the local HTTP sidecar boundary before touching an external XMPP account:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh start-bridge
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh bridge-auth-check
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh bridge-status
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh stop-bridge
```

`bridge-auth-check` verifies two things:

- `GET /v1/status` without the bearer token is rejected.
- `GET /v1/status` with the generated bearer token succeeds.

The smoke test does the same sequence and stops the bridge unless
`LUNARWING_TEST_KEEP_BRIDGE=1` is set.

## Live XMPP Configuration

Edit the generated bridge env file:

```bash
${LUNARWING_TEST_ROOT:-/tmp/lunarwing-xmpp-test}/env/xmpp-bridge.env
```

Set at least:

- `XMPP_JID`
- `XMPP_PASSWORD`
- `XMPP_ALLOW_ROOMS_JSON`, or pass room JIDs as command arguments

Then configure the running bridge through the existing wrapper:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh start-bridge
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh configure-bridge --show-status room@conference.example.org
```

For live outbound safety, use the rate-limit wrapper:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh rate-limit status
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh rate-limit set 20 --reset
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh rate-limit off
```

The rate-limit command changes the live bridge override only. Restarting the
bridge resets the override back to bridge configuration defaults.

## Running LunarWing Locally

The harness can start the `lunarwing` binary with isolated state:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh start-lunarwing
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh lunarwing-status
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh stop-lunarwing
```

By default this runs:

```bash
target/debug/lunarwing --no-onboard run
```

Use your isolated `LUNARWING_BASE_DIR` (legacy alias `IRONCLAW_BASE_DIR`) for
onboarding or live credentials instead of sharing `~/.lunarwing`:

```bash
set -a
. /tmp/lunarwing-xmpp-test/env/lunarwing.env
set +a
target/debug/lunarwing onboard
```

For alternate runtime flags, pass the full argument list after `--`:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh start-lunarwing -- --no-onboard --no-db run
```

## User Systemd Method

This is the preferred install-style test path on systemd hosts. It keeps the
Postgres-backed harness alive after the invoking shell exits, which is more
reliable than leaving `up` running from an interactive or agent-managed shell.

Generate user-service units from your current checkout and test root:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh render-systemd
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp /tmp/lunarwing-xmpp-test/systemd/*.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart lunarwing-test.service
```

The default generated service names are deliberately test-scoped:

- `lunarwing-test.service`
- `xmpp-bridge-test.service`

To render actual service names, set both names before `render-systemd`:

```bash
export LUNARWING_TEST_SERVICE_NAME=lunarwing.service
export LUNARWING_TEST_BRIDGE_SERVICE_NAME=xmpp-bridge.service
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh render-systemd
```

The bridge `PartOf=`, LunarWing `Wants=` / `After=`, and
`configure-bridge --restart` path all use the same configured bridge/main
service names, so renaming the main unit does not leave stale
`ironclaw.service` links in the generated test units.

For generated user services, `configure-bridge --restart` uses `systemctl --user`
by default. For machine-level services, set
`LUNARWING_TEST_SYSTEMCTL_SCOPE=system`.

Before using the full Postgres-backed path, make sure Docker is running because
the harness starts PostgreSQL in a local container.

The generated units inherit the current harness env file, including
`ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=1`, `DATABASE_SSLMODE=disable`, and `PGSSLMODE=disable`.

Starting `lunarwing-test.service` is enough; it already pulls in
`xmpp-bridge-test.service` and `lunarwing-proxy-test.service` through
`Wants=` / `After=`.

Use read-only diagnostics before restarting anything:

```bash
systemctl --user status xmpp-bridge-test.service
systemctl --user show xmpp-bridge-test.service
journalctl --user -u xmpp-bridge-test.service -n 100 --no-pager
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh bridge-status
```

If the test stack is already running from manual `start-*` commands, stop those
first so the service-managed units can bind the same ports cleanly.

The generated bridge unit has `PartOf=` pointing at the configured LunarWing
service name, so LunarWing service stops can also stop the bridge. Do not
assume the bridge caused a LunarWing stop just because both units changed state
together.

The built-in Rust service manager also uses the LunarWing name now.
`lunarwing service install` detects the host service manager:

- systemd: installs `~/.config/systemd/user/lunarwing.service` and, when the
  bridge binary is available, `xmpp-bridge.service`
- OpenRC: installs `/etc/init.d/lunarwing` and `/etc/init.d/xmpp-bridge`

During systemd installs it attempts to disable the legacy user unit
`ironclaw.service` if that old unit file exists, preventing both daemon names
from being enabled together.

## System Service Method

Production-ready system service templates live in:

- `systemd/lunarwing.service`
- `systemd/xmpp-bridge.service`

They assume:

- a dedicated `lunarwing` system user and group
- binaries at `/usr/local/bin/lunarwing` and `/usr/local/bin/xmpp-bridge`
- state under `/var/lib/lunarwing`
- logs under `/var/log/lunarwing`
- root-readable env files under `/etc/lunarwing`

Create the service account and config directory:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --home-dir /var/lib/lunarwing --shell /usr/sbin/nologin lunarwing
sudo install -d -o root -g root -m 0750 /etc/lunarwing
sudo install -d -o lunarwing -g lunarwing -m 0750 /var/lib/lunarwing /var/log/lunarwing
```

Keep secrets in root-readable env files:

- `/etc/lunarwing/lunarwing.env`
- `/etc/lunarwing/xmpp-bridge.env`

The committed `lunarwing.service` and OpenRC templates already seed
`ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=1` and `PGSSLMODE=disable` for private-network Postgres and
OpenAI-compatible lab setups. Override those in `/etc/lunarwing/lunarwing.env`
only when your deployment needs different SSL or network behavior.

Use `EnvironmentFile=` instead of inline `Environment=` entries for tokens,
database URLs, provider keys, webhook secrets, or XMPP passwords. The bridge
should remain loopback-bound:

```ini
XMPP_BRIDGE_BIND=127.0.0.1:8787
```

Install and start the services:

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 systemd/xmpp-bridge.service /etc/systemd/system/xmpp-bridge.service
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 systemd/lunarwing.service /etc/systemd/system/lunarwing.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now xmpp-bridge.service
sudo systemctl enable --now lunarwing.service
```

Install the production watchdog scheduler when you want the host to check and
restart LunarWing hourly:

```bash
sudo scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
```

On systemd hosts, that installs `lunarwing-watchdog.service` plus
`lunarwing-watchdog.timer` and you can inspect them with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status lunarwing-watchdog.timer --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u lunarwing-watchdog.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

On OpenRC hosts, the same installer now detects OpenRC and installs:

- `/usr/local/sbin/lunarwing-watchdog-openrc`
- `/etc/conf.d/lunarwing-watchdog`
- either:
  - an hourly hook under `/etc/cron.hourly/` or `/etc/periodic/hourly/`, or
  - a managed root `fcrontab` entry

The default `auto` mode is conservative:

- if `cronie`, `crond`, or `dcron` is already present, the installer keeps the
  cron-hourly path and does not switch you over to `fcron`
- if no cron-hourly daemon is present but `fcron` is available, the installer
  uses a managed `fcrontab` entry for root instead

You can override the choice with:

```bash
sudo LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_SCHEDULER=fcron scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
sudo LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_SCHEDULER=hourly scripts/install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh
```

`LUNARWING_WATCHDOG_CRON_DIR` still applies when you explicitly want the hourly
hook path in a nonstandard directory layout.

Migration note: `install-lunarwing-watchdog.sh` disables and removes old
`ironclaw-watchdog` units, wrappers, and hourly hooks before installing the
renamed watchdog so duplicate checks do not run side by side.

Inspect `systemctl status`, `systemctl show`, `journalctl`, and `/v1/status`
before restarting services.

## Future Targeted Checks

Keep these as follow-up harness checks when the current setup work is stable:

- `Live XMPP end-to-end`: use a real test JID/password plus one DM target or
  room to prove `/v1/configure`, polling, and outbound send work against a real
  XMPP service.
- `Secrets-only XMPP password`: remove `XMPP_PASSWORD` from `lunarwing.env`,
  insert it through the secret-management scripts, restart, and confirm the
  channel still loads from the secrets store.
- `Gotify real send`: add a real `gotify_app_token`, set `gotify_url`, and make
  the tool send one notification.
- `Dual-instance socket isolation`: run two harness roots at once and confirm
  each gets its own `run/lunarwing.sock` and `repl` attaches to the correct
  daemon.
- `Init idempotence`: run `init` twice on the same root after customizing env
  values and confirm the harness preserves user-edited tokens, DB mode, agent
  name, and XMPP fields.
- `DB parity`: repeat the same secret insert, restart, and verify flow once on
  `libsql` and once on `postgres` to catch backend-specific regressions.
- `Service restart behavior`: restart only `lunarwing-test.service` and confirm
  the DB, seeded docs, REPL socket, and XMPP migration all recover cleanly.

## Troubleshooting

Run:

```bash
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh doctor
scripts/lunarwing-xmpp-test-env.sh logs 120
```

Common checks:

- `curl` is required for bridge API calls.
- `jq` is required by the existing configure and rate-limit wrappers.
- `cargo` is required for `build`.
- `bridge-status` returning `401` or `403` usually means the wrong token or env
  file is being used.
- `gateway-status` now reports the requested harness channels as `xmpp`,
  `weechat`, and `darkirc`. The Gotify tool shows up in
  `/api/extensions/tools` as `gotify-tool`.
- A running system bridge on port `8787` can conflict with the harness bridge.
  Change `XMPP_BRIDGE_BIND` in the test env file when needed.
- `verify` treats the proxy as healthy when `:3002` returns any HTTP response.
  That confirms the local shim is running even if the upstream TensorZero
  service returns `404` or `500` for `GET /openai/v1/models`.
