# Phase 2/3 chaos harness for lunarwing-self-heal.sh — sections 4 & 5 of
# docs/proposals/CHAOS_ENGINEERING_TEST_PLAN.md.
#
# Unlike the dry-run unit matrix, this drives the REAL self-heal loop (no
# --dry-run) end-to-end: it injects a fault, lets self-heal restart/verify, and
# checks the outcome — recovery, escalation, flap-stop, grace-absorption, and
# multi-tenant blast-radius isolation.
#
# It is still safe to run anywhere. Every fault is injected into a *mock init
# system* (fake systemctl/rc-service/sudo + fake component health checks, see
# lib.sh:mk_mockbin) driven entirely by files under a throwaway sandbox. The
# mock shadows the real binaries on PATH, so a "restart" flips a sandbox file —
# never a real unit. Escalation runs the real send-notification.sh but with an
# empty GOTIFY_TOKEN, so it short-circuits before any network call.
#
# Each scenario simulates cron ticks by invoking self-heal repeatedly; backoff
# base is 0 so retries are not gated across the simulated ticks.
#
# Run:  bash tests/chaos-harness.sh   (exit 0 = all pass)
