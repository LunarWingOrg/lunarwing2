# LunarWing Infrastructure Health Check + Self-Healing Cron Wrapper
#
# Called by systemd timer, cron.hourly, or fcron to run the full
# health-check → self-heal pipeline. Detects its own location so
# it works regardless of where the infrastructure health-check
# directory is installed.
#
# Any arguments are forwarded verbatim to lunarwing-self-heal.sh, so
# `./cron-wrapper.sh --dry-run` exercises the whole pipeline without restarting
# anything.
#
# Usage:
#   ./cron-wrapper.sh [self-heal args...]
#
# Environment:
#   LUNARWING_BASE_DIR  Base directory for LunarWing data (default: $HOME/.lunarwing).
#                       Honored by the child scripts; the wrapper locates its own
#                       siblings via BASH_SOURCE, so the install path is auto-detected.
