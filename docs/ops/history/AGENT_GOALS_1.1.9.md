2. [x] Prepare fully detailed report detailing all remaining nearai/near/ironclaw/nearcloud/nearagent/near::agent/telegram references in the source code and documentation. put it in docs/internal as a new markdown document
3. [x] There are old automated testing scripts in this repo. Bring them up to date (within reason - totally fine if stuff is missing; just document what is)
4. [x] The new mt admin setup cli wrapper needs to have upgrade in place functionality. enhance it to make this possible. or if it has it already by this point, verify it has it already. The human will test later so there's no need to run any tests at this time.
5. [x] Go thru all the issues and make a report in docs/ops of the status of each issue and see if each is solved already or not https://github.com/LunarWingOrg/lunarwing/issues
6. [x] inspect status of cargo crates and create documented report of any crates that might still need to be updated
