# PRE-RELEASE CHECKLIST for 1.1.8 Codename `Tatara`
**Open TODOs (1.1.8) — To be done before release**

### Helps to do items in order (generally)

1. [x] Finalize goals
2. [x] rm gh extension and verify it does not show up
3. [x] rm default mcps and verify they do not show up on fresh installation
4. [x] ssh agent adjustments (option #2 and #3 and hardening)
5. [x] Agent SSH Rust Tool
6. [x] Agent SSH WASM TOOL
7. [x] Self-Healing capability expansion, decided to defer this (find the missing mysterious 1.1.8 self healing expansion doc first)
8. [x] Add new external worker, opencode. Landed: `opencode4lunarwing/` (Bun/TypeScript bridge + `@opencode-ai/sdk`, `ironclaw-agent-v1` protocol), port registry v10→v11 migration (`opencode_wss`/`opencode_health`), full mt-admin lifecycle (build/configure/start/stop/doctor/status/list), `--with-opencode`, `--opencode-model`/`--opencode-base-url`. Optional Paseo MCP integration wired behind `PASEO_URL`/`PASEO_TOKEN`. Polish follow-ups and repo-doc updates tracked in archived `DEFERRED-2026-07-02-OPENCODE-EXTERNAL-WORKER.md` (now in `docs/internal/history/archive/proposals/`).
9. [x] Test Opencode external worker properly (might help to update some of the old test scripts too) 
10. [x] test add-tenant and add-tenants enhancements. xmpp_jid_from, llm_model, gateway-host. also interactive onboarding in 1.1.8 or 1.1.9 - make note of decision later
11. [x] see what else we can do from roadmap planned for 1.1.9 a little earlier
12. [x] darkirc multi-tenant fix to make actually disabled and NOT BUILT unless enabled and build-darkirc flag also enabled
13. [x] finish improvements to routines - See docs/proposals/ROUTINE_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md
14. [x] Bump crate versions to 1.1.8
15. [x] Ensure all relevant crates are bumped to 1.1.8
16. [x] Update any stale documentation
17. [x] Update repo root-level README.md — release-notes link fixed (v1.1.7→v1.1.8, broken root path → docs/releases/), DarkIRC hard-disable/opt-in noted (intro + Features section), worker-count language reconciled (nanocode/pebble/opencode external + built-in/sandbox), Agent SSH Harness v1.1.8 tooling completion noted, new "Upgrading & Migration" section added (kawarimi + legacy upgrade tooling, all links verified). Community button (#28) deferred pending maintainer design input.
18. [x] Update ROADMAP file to reflect accuracy
19. [x] Run all cargo tests — full `--all-features --no-fail-fast` run: lib 4087 passed/0 failed/4 ignored; all integration binaries + doctests pass except the 6 known-deferred (4 `multi_tenant_system_prompt` architectural, 2 `e2e_advanced_traces` bootstrap-greeting). See `docs/proposals/CARGO_TESTS_FIX.md`.
20. [x] Fix any remaining broken cargo tests and ensure updated documentation. Create (or rewrite) new tests if necessary. then re-run cargo tests to ensure — Fixed the 3 stale `lib` failures this cycle: `registry::embedded::tests::test_load_embedded_parses` (github→ssh sentinel), `cli::tests::test_help_output` + `test_long_help_output` (accepted rebranded insta snapshots). Lib re-run: 4087 passed/0 failed. The 6 remaining failures are documented known-deferred (architectural / harness), not regressions.
21. [x] Retest expo
22. [x] Perform successful upgrade in place route with legacy upgrade harness. Document legacy upgrade harness success and plan unified upgrade harness v3
23. [x] Run automated testing scripts if still relevant
24. [x] Need a full extensive test using testing_guide and other testing scripts (if they are still relevant) See docs/guides/TESTING_GUIDE.md and ic/scripts/release-test.sh
25. [x] Retest kawarimi tenant migration (export/import full process)
26. [x] Full integrated testing (makes it easier to use kawarimi tenant for this item actually)
27. [x] Write up FIRST DRAFT release notes (at root of repo) for v1.1.8 explaining all changes since v1.1.7 as well as revising and including an ACCURATE VERSION OF `known issues list`
28. [x] Go over every single section of first draft of release notes (at root of repo) to correct all sections since information is now outdated (only after #27)
29. [x] make cool community button for readme. I have some unique idea about this — Added IRC chat badge (`#lunarwing` on Libera, links to web chat) in lunarpunk teal/black matching the existing zread badge aesthetic. Placed in both the top badge cluster and the Community section.
30. [x] Update release date in release notes prior to last two steps below
31. [ ] Create new branch to correspond with releases
32. [ ] Create GH release tag and add release notes to it like other releases already have
