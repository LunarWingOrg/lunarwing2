# Roadmap Document

Items are grouped to respect the release cadence (`docs/ops/RELEASE_CADENCE.md`): odd-numbered releases focus on bug fixes / security / polish / cleanup, even-numbered releases focus on features, and major versions such as 2.0.0 or 2.1.0 will typically include massive overhauls of existing systems.

| Feature | Target |
|---------|--------|
| XMPP file transfer — remaining polish (further hardening) | v2.0.1 |
| Drop legacy `ironclaw-agent-v1` acceptance from external workers (pebble/lunarcode/opencode `LEGACY_SUBPROTOCOL` constants + negotiation fallback), one release after the daemon stops offering it | v2.0.1 |
| Org/registry decisions deferred from 1.1.9 item #2: re-host registry WASM artifacts or make them source-build-only (nearai/ironclaw release URLs in `ic/registry/*.json` + `installer.rs` allowlist), fix or delete the `release-plz.yml` `repository_owner == 'nearai'` guard — fits alongside the Forgejo/CI migration. The Docker Hub image namespace was moved to `ggmethos/*` and the obsolete GCP VM bootstrap path was removed in 1.1.9 cleanup. | v2.0.1 |
| Further polishing of Lunarvision AND XMPP file sharing integration - see XMPP_LUNARVISION_INTEGRATION.md in docs/proposals for some information | v2.0.1 |
| In-place Upgrade Harness v3/v4 to cover ALL version upgrades, rather than separate legacy and non-legacy upgrade scripts | v2.0.1 |

| Better githooks for repo | v2.0.1 |
