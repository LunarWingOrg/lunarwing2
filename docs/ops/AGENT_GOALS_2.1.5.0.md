## Phase 1 — Foundation (engine, crates & architecture)

1. [ ] Last attempt was merged in but has multiple CI/CD failures.... See pipeline #4679 for all failing jobs... there are multiple.... please address and fix these....Update all external crates that need updating for the entire project - See previous release notes for examples of such crates. Ensure CI/CD is also updated for the new crate versions. Exit criteria: cargo check clean on all feature combos, cargo deny check clean, CI green on a scratch branch. worker pins, external crates, ci/cd must all be included in this. LunarWing crates must be bumped from 2.1.4 to 2.1.5 and all crates which require a version bump must also be bumped such as channel wasms. There should not be any 2.1.4 LunarWing crates left. Refer to goals doc from aragents/kimil00p/v2.1.4.0 in order to be thorough. all LunarWing-owned release packages, workspace crates, XMPP bridge, and WASM channels must be updated and lockfiles refreshed. All channel registry packages need bump. A tracked-manifest/lock audit must confirm no project-owned package or path dependency remains at 2.1.4 - External crates audit and update must be completed - ic/vendor/ must be regenerated - Worker/CI audit must be completed - cargo deny check and all associated things usually done with each release should be done. there may be docs guidance that you need to update. See older releases for more info on this if any clarification is needed. External worker upgrades such as kimi, opencode2, pebble, etc may be done in a seperate goal item
2. [ ] update external workers - opencode2 to 2.0.21 - NEW VERSION - update from 2.0.20

## Phase 2 — Features & Polish

3. [ ] audit all crates and ensure there are no security vulnerabilities

## Phase 4 — Carried Known-Issues from RELEASE-v2.1.3.0.md (for goals referencing work items, read comments on work items as well)

   - DONE 100% (2026-10-03, branch aj/kimi-6-20261003-0800): watcher's GatePaused arm now discards any pending gate armed for the thread before finalize — new `finalize_regated_expired_turn` helper in `ic/src/bridge/router.rs` (NotFound is the common no-op case). Regression test `expired_gate_regated_wrap_up_discards_rearmed_gate` fixtures a real expiry-resume → re-pause cycle with an armed gate and asserts the store empties (verified red without the discard). Evidence: `cargo test --lib expired_gate` 8/8 pass; `cargo clippy --lib --tests -D warnings` clean; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.

## Phase 5 - Miscellaneous (for goals referencing work items, read comments on work items as well)

21. [ ] take a look at any documentation that should be updated and update necessary documentation
22. [ ] create release notes draft at the root of the repo (as we usually do with each release; see previous release notes in docs/releases for reference)
23. [ ] review all currently open work items - create audit document for 2.1.5.0 in docs/ops - there are similar docs in docs/ops for 2.1.4.0 and earlier releases so you can use those as references
24. [ ] update all docs in docs/guides
25. [ ] update all docs in docs/architecture
26. [ ] fix issues in CI/CD (if any) - See Pipeline number 4975 for latest master pipeline run and see if anything is not GREEN (cargo deny has issue now at the least)
27. [ ] come up with ideas for names for 2.1.5.0 - write in a document in docs/ops
28. [ ] Repo housecleaning: 1) get rid of old stuff in docs/ops and move it to history 2) remove docs/ov directory
