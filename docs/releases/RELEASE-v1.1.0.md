# Release Notes for LunarWing v1.1.0 - Codename Evolution

**Release Date:** 2026-06-04

## Overview

LunarWing v1.1.0 is a major feature and bugfix combined release bringing the pre-release version of Multica/Lunartica integration, expanded multi-tenant tooling for Pebble and WeeChat ws_adapter, improved LLM resilience, and cross-backend migration support. This release also includes critical concurrency fixes for the workspace/memory write path (6 bugs causing data loss, pool exhaustion, and search inconsistency under concurrent loads), fixes for the WASM sandbox wildcard host matching that prevented tools from making HTTP requests or receiving credential injection, and a new workspace reader for WASM tools enabling agent self-configuration. In addition, it includes major bug fixes related to the new agent_loop.rs and a long-time (since Ironclaw) rare bug where when certain reasoning models return rubbish responses, which clean_response stripped to empty text and caused a temporary `lapse` without any debug logging or retry mechanism (this has been further explained in the release notes below). Additional changes in this release include improvements to workspace seeding and an easier onboarding process for new users (complete with a new quick MT setup guide for getting LunarWing and one of the channels up and running).

## Changes

### Multica/Lunartica Bridge WASM Tool & Channel

Initial integration with the Multica self-hostable agent orchestration server:

- **`multica-bridge` WASM tool** (`ic/tools-src/multica-bridge/`) — Phase 1 & 2 complete. Provides bridge capabilities with schema definitions, configuration module, and capabilities manifest. Registered in `ic/registry/tools/multica-bridge.json`.
- **`multica` WASM channel** (`ic/channels-src/multica/`) — Phase 2 complete. Channel source with build script, capabilities manifest, and registry entry at `ic/registry/channels/multica.json`.
- **`multica-poll` skill** (`ic/skills/multica-poll/`) — Skill prompt for polling Multica.
- **Multica deployment guide** (`docs/guides/MULTICA_DEPLOYMENT.md`) — Server compatibility verification and deployment walkthrough.
- **Compatibility confirmed** (`docs/proposals/MULTICA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_CONFIRMED.md`) — Verification that Multica server is compatible with the bridge tool.
- **WASM tool workspace reader** — WASM tools declaring `workspace` capability can now read from the database-backed workspace memory. Previously, tools had `reader: None` injected at registration time, silently breaking `workspace_read()` for all WASM tools. The fix pre-loads workspace documents matching the tool's allowed prefixes before WASM execution and injects a `PreloadedWorkspaceReader`. This enables agent self-configuration: agents can write `config/multica.json` via `memory_write` and the tool reads it via `workspace_read`.
- **Config fallback** — `load_config()` now falls back to individual workspace keys (`config/multica_url`, `config/multica_workspace_id`, etc.) when the JSON config file is not present, allowing incremental configuration.
- **Multica security analysis** (`docs/architecture/MULTICA-SEC.md`) — Documents the security model for the bridge tool, confirming workspace data is database-backed (not filesystem), config values are not secrets, and the WIT boundary is sound.
- **Fully Functional** - Bridge itself is fully functional with workspace read.
- **Experimental** - Multica and Lunartica support is still new and marked as experimental, but will continue to be prioritized in development going forward and is as a great self-hostable solution for orchestrating multi-agent workflows!

### Pebble Worker Multi-Tenant Support

The `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh` script now fully supports Pebble worker lifecycle:

- **`build-tenant --with-pebble`** — Builds the Pebble worker Docker image as part of tenant provisioning. Also available via `build-all --with-pebble` and standalone `build-pebble-worker`.
- **`configure-pebble <name>`** — New command to configure the Pebble worker for a tenant, accepting `--nanogpt-api-key` and `--model` (default: `openai/gpt-5.2`).
- **Pebble Dockerfile improvements** — Builder stage now clones Pebble from upstream (`nanogpt-community/pebble`) via shallow git clone instead of requiring a local copy, making builds self-contained.

### WeeChat ws_adapter Multi-Tenant Support

Full multi-tenant lifecycle management for the WeeChat WebSocket adapter:

- **Port registry v5** — The `reserved_3` port slot is now `weechat_adapter`. Existing registries are auto-migrated (v4 -> v5). New tenants get `weechat_adapter` at base+9. The `ports list` output now includes a `WS_ADPT` column.
- **Systemd and OpenRC service templates** — `add-tenant` now renders and installs `lunarwing-weechat-adapter-<tenant>` service units for both init systems, with proper `After=` ordering, environment passthrough (`WEECHAT_ADAPTER_PORT`, `RELAY_URL`, `RELAY_PASSWORD`), and `PartOf=` dependency on the main tenant service.
- **Configurable adapter port** — `ws_adapter.py` now reads `WEECHAT_ADAPTER_PORT` as an env var (in addition to the existing `ADAPTER_PORT`), allowing per-tenant port assignment without CLI flags.

### LLM Request Timeout Fix for rig-core Providers

The `openai_compatible`, `anthropic`, and `ollama` providers were silently ignoring the `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` configuration (default 120s). The factory functions in `ic/src/llm/mod.rs` did not pass the timeout parameter to rig-core's client builder, causing these providers to fall back to reqwest's default timeout instead of the user-configured value.

All three rig-core-based provider factories now build a `reqwest::Client` with the configured timeout and inject it via `.http_client()`:

- `create_openai_compat_from_registry(config, request_timeout_secs)`
- `create_anthropic_from_registry(config, request_timeout_secs)`
- `create_ollama_from_registry(config, request_timeout_secs)`

The timeout value is now logged in each provider's `tracing::debug!` output. Providers that already applied the timeout correctly are unaffected.

### libSQL-to-PostgreSQL Migration Tooling

Added scripts and documentation to support cross-backend migration from legacy Ironclaw libSQL instances to LunarWing multi-tenant PostgreSQL:

- **`ic/scripts/export-libsql.sh`** — Exports all tables from an Ironclaw libSQL database as CSV files, using Python's `csv` module for reliable handling of multiline values and binary data
- **`ic/scripts/import-to-pg.sh`** — Imports exported CSVs into a tenant's PostgreSQL database with explicit column lists, FK constraint deferral, and sequence reset
- **`ic/scripts/reimport-fixes.sh`** — Handles re-import of tables that require special treatment: hex-encoded BYTEA columns for `secrets`, Python-based CSV re-export for `settings` (JSON quoting), and `agent_jobs` (multiline descriptions)
- **`docs/guides/MIGRATE_IRONCLAW_LIBSQL_TO_MT.md`** — Updated with additional notes from real production live migrations.

Also performed more testing of this process from various versions of Ironclaw including 0.24.0 and 0.25.0.

### Tool Calling Diagnostic Script

Added `ic/scripts/lunarwing_toolcall_diag.py` — a standalone diagnostic script that tests tool call functionality against a running LunarWing instance. Validates that the LLM provider can generate properly-formatted tool calls and that the agent processes them correctly.

### Port Registry v5 Migration

The multi-tenant port registry has been upgraded from v4 to v5, reclaiming the last reserved slot for the WeeChat ws_adapter:

- **`reserved_3` renamed to `weechat_adapter`** — New tenants allocate `weechat_adapter` at base+9. Existing registries are auto-migrated inline during `add-tenant` or `ports list`.
- **Standalone migration script** — `ic/scripts/migrate-ports-v5.sh` performs the v4-to-v5 migration independently of `mt-admin`, for operators who need to migrate registries without provisioning a new tenant. Requires root and validates the current version before acting.
- **`ports list` updated** — Output now includes a `WS_ADPT` column reflecting the new slot.

### Workspace/Memory Concurrency Fixes

Six concurrency bugs in the workspace/memory write path were discovered during pre-release stress testing and fixed. Under concurrent write loads (8+ simultaneous operations), agents experienced data loss, silent failures, timeouts, and stale search results. Normal sequential agent operation was never affected. See `docs/bugs/BUG-workspace-concurrency-fixes-v1.1.0.md` for the full analysis.

- **NULL-safe unique constraint** — PostgreSQL `UNIQUE` constraints do not prevent duplicates when `agent_id IS NULL`. Migration V21 adds `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` constraint; libSQL gets a `COALESCE` expression index.
- **Atomic `get_or_create_document_by_path`** — Replaced a 3-connection check/insert/fetch sequence with a single atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... RETURNING *` statement. Connection usage per operation reduced from 2-3 to 1.
- **Atomic SQL append** — Added `append_document()` to the `WorkspaceStore` trait. Concatenation now happens in SQL (`content || separator || new_content`) rather than read-modify-write across separate connections.
- **Connection-efficient reindex** — Embedding generation now runs without holding database connections. Added `prepare_chunks()` helper and `replace_chunks()` trait method. Connection usage per write reduced from ~6+N to ~3.
- **Atomic document + chunk update** — Added `update_document_and_replace_chunks()` to wrap content update and chunk replacement in a single transaction, eliminating search inconsistency windows.
- **3 regression tests** covering concurrent unique-path writes, concurrent same-path appends, and concurrent get_or_create returning the same document ID.

### WASM Sandbox Bare Wildcard Host Fix

The WASM HTTP allowlist and credential injector both supported subdomain wildcards (`*.example.com`) but did not treat bare `*` as a universal wildcard. Tools declaring `"host": "*"` in their capabilities (like multica-bridge) had all HTTP requests silently blocked and all credential injections silently skipped.

- **`EndpointPattern::host_matches()`** — Now returns `true` when `self.host == "*"`.
- **`host_matches_pattern()`** in credential injector — Same fix applied to the credential injection host matching.
- **2 regression tests** added for bare wildcard matching in both code paths.

### Stuck-Run Recovery Hardening

The hard-timeout path in the agent loop was significantly tightened:

- **Stuck window reduced from ~600s to ~30s** — Previously, the hard-kill timer waited a full second `handle_message_timeout` period (~600s with defaults) before aborting a stuck task. Now it fires after `HARD_KILL_GRACE_SECS` (30s), reducing the window where new messages queue indefinitely behind an orphaned task.
- **Orphaned task abort** — The hard-kill path now calls `abort_handle.abort()` to actually cancel the stuck tokio task, rather than just resetting thread state around it.
- **Pending message cleanup** — New `fail_turn_hard()` method clears the thread's `pending_messages` queue on hard timeout, preventing stale queued messages from leaking into future turns. The normal `fail_turn()` still preserves pending messages for the requeue-on-error recovery path.
- **3 regression tests** added covering `fail_turn_hard` queue clearing, `fail_turn` queue preservation, and no-op on empty threads.

### Onboarding Bootstrap Rework

Bootstrap workspace seeding now respects a new `ONBOARD_COMPLETED` environment variable:

- **Multi-tenant skip** — When `ONBOARD_COMPLETED=true` is set (as multi-tenant provisioning does), the setup wizard and bootstrap seeding are skipped entirely. Previously only the TOML `profile_onboarding_completed` flag was checked, which required a first-run cycle to set.
- **Single-tenant unchanged** — For single-tenant instances, the flag defaults to `false` and the normal first-run onboarding flow is preserved.
- **BOOTSTRAP.md removed from workspace template** — The bootstrap prompt file (`ic/deploy/workspace-template/BOOTSTRAP.md`) was removed; onboarding logic is now fully code-driven.

### Multi-Tenant Admin Improvements

- **`--llm-api-key` flag for `add-tenant`** — API key for the LLM backend can now be passed directly during tenant provisioning, eliminating the need to manually edit `lunarwing.env` after creation.
- **TensorZero default URL corrected** — Default upstream URL changed from `http://192.168.1.157:3000` to `http://192.168.1.157:3000/openai/v1`, fixing routing for OpenAI-compatible proxy paths.
- **Build reminder** — `build-tenant` now prints a post-build reminder at the end of output with next-step instructions.
- **Tenant Configuration Guide** — New `docs/ops/TENANT-CONFIGURATION.md` (331 lines) covering post-provisioning customization: file layout, LLM provider switching, XMPP bridge setup, Gotify, routine management, env var priority order, and applying changes across init systems.

### Crate Version Alignment

All workspace crates have been unified at version 1.1.0. Previously the main `lunarwing` crate was at 1.0.9 while the four internal crates (`lunarwing_common`, `lunarwing_safety`, `lunarwing_skills`, `lunarwing_engine`) and the XMPP bridge remained at 1.0.0. Going forward, all crates will be bumped together for each release.

| Crate | Previous | New |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `lunarwing` (main) | 1.0.9 | 1.1.0 |
| `lunarwing_common` | 1.0.0 | 1.1.0 |
| `lunarwing_safety` | 1.0.0 | 1.1.0 |
| `lunarwing_skills` | 1.0.0 | 1.1.0 |
| `lunarwing_engine` | 1.0.0 | 1.1.0 |
| `xmpp-bridge` | 1.0.0 | 1.1.0 |

## Bug Fixes

- **Empty-response "momentary lapse" fix (enhanced)** — Reasoning models (Qwen3, DeepSeek R1, Gemma 4, GLM-5) occasionally return responses consisting entirely of `<think>` tags, which `clean_response` strips to empty text. Previously, the agent silently substituted "I'm not sure how to respond to that." with no retry and no diagnostic logging. Now `respond_with_tools` retries up to `MAX_EMPTY_RESPONSE_RETRIES` (default 1, meaning 2 total attempts) before falling back. Added `truncate_for_log()` helper for safe diagnostic output, explicit handling for `None` content responses, and 6 regression tests covering the retry and fallback paths.
- **LLM timeout not applied to rig-core providers** — `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` was silently ignored for `openai_compatible`, `anthropic`, and `ollama` backends. See Changes section above for details.
- **Tool call diagnostic script error** — Fixed Python script that was not correctly referencing its entry point
- **Stuck tasks blocking message queue** — Hard-timeout recovery left orphaned tokio tasks running and stale pending messages in the queue. See Stuck-Run Recovery Hardening above.
- **TensorZero default URL missing path** — Multi-tenant admin default upstream URL was missing the `/openai/v1` path suffix, causing routing failures for OpenAI-compatible proxy requests.
- **Multi-tenant bootstrap seeding on provisioned tenants** — Tenants created via `mt-admin` would still receive the first-run onboarding flow because only the TOML flag was checked. Now respects `ONBOARD_COMPLETED` env var.
- **Workspace ghost writes under concurrent unique-path writes** — PostgreSQL `UNIQUE` constraints with `NULL agent_id` allowed duplicate rows, causing data loss. Fixed via `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` migration (V21) and atomic `get_or_create_document_by_path`. See Workspace/Memory Concurrency Fixes above.
- **Workspace append race condition** — Concurrent appends to the same path used a read-modify-write pattern across separate connections, silently losing all but the last write. Fixed with atomic SQL append.
- **Connection pool exhaustion at 10+ concurrent writes** — `reindex_document()` held database connections during embedding network calls, starving the pool. Fixed by computing embeddings without holding connections.
- **Search index inconsistency after writes** — Content and chunk updates happened in separate transactions, creating a window where search returned stale or zero results. Fixed with atomic document + chunk replacement.
- **WASM tool workspace reads always returned None** — WASM tools with `workspace` capability had `reader: None` injected at registration, silently breaking `workspace_read()`. Fixed by pre-loading workspace data before WASM execution and injecting a `PreloadedWorkspaceReader`.
- **Bare `*` wildcard ignored in WASM HTTP allowlist** — `host_matches()` only handled `*.domain.com` subdomain wildcards. Tools declaring `"host": "*"` had all HTTP requests blocked. Fixed in both `EndpointPattern::host_matches()` and `host_matches_pattern()` in the credential injector.
- **WASM credential injection skipped for `*` host patterns** — Same bare wildcard bug in the credential injector prevented `Authorization` headers from being injected for tools with `"host_patterns": ["*"]`.

- Began some of the implementation work to port some of the unique and useful features from Hermes Agent to LunarWing. This work is not included in this release, but there is documentation present for it.
- `GOALS_1.1.0.md` created with release milestone targets
- `docs/bugs/BUG-workspace-concurrency-fixes-v1.1.0.md` — Full analysis of 6 concurrency bugs found during pre-release stress testing, including root causes, fixes, regression tests, and stress test results
- `docs/architecture/MULTICA-SEC.md` — Security analysis of the multica-bridge workspace/secret boundary model
- `docs/ops/XMPP_KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — Known XMPP issues including OMEMO device trust requirements and inbound XEP-0363 file upload limitation (outbound supported, inbound OOB parsing not yet implemented)

## Known Issues

- **`wasm-tools` not found on build** — Cosmetic warning during `build-tenant --with-wasm`. Raw WASM files are copied without stripping/componentizing. Functionality is unaffected; install `wasm-tools` to eliminate the warning.
- **Gotify skill frontmatter** — Legacy `GOTIFYSKILL.md` files from Ironclaw may have missing YAML frontmatter delimiters, causing a skill load warning on startup. Does not affect Gotify native wasm tool functionality.
- **5 tests are failing due to not being updated after previous production code refactors. No production code is broken and these test failures have been throroughly documented.** - See docs/bugs for further information on these test failures and proposed fixes.
- **One test is failing due to an assertion count mismatch**
- **One test is failing due to env-specific SSRF check.**
- **Two tests for gateway workflow harness and test_rig from the test harness are failing for similar reasons to the ones above.** - See docs/bugs for further information on these test failures and proposed fixes.
- **Several E2E playwright tests may also need to be updated to account for major code refactoring.**
- **XMPP inbound file uploads not supported** — The bridge supports outbound XEP-0363 HTTP file uploads but does not parse inbound OOB (`<x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'>`) elements from incoming stanzas. Files sent to the agent via XMPP are silently ignored. See `docs/ops/XMPP_KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

## Upgrade Notes

1. **Database migrations**: V19 (reflex patterns), V20 (reflex embeddings), and V21 (NULL-safe unique constraint on `memory_documents`) will run automatically on startup. V21 deduplicates any existing rows with NULL `agent_id` before adding the constraint. **Back up your database before upgrading.** PostgreSQL 15+ is required for V21's `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` syntax.
2. **Ironclaw migration**: Agents running on the legacy Ironclaw fork can now be migrated using the new export/import scripts. See `docs/guides/MIGRATE_IRONCLAW_LIBSQL_TO_MT.md` for the full walkthrough. Preserve the `SECRET_MASTER_KEY` from the old instance to ensure encrypted secrets remain accessible.
3. **Tenant git remotes**: Tenant repos created before v1.0.8 may have their git origin pointing to a local path (`/home/cmc/lunarwing`) instead of the GitHub remote. Fix with `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/LunarWingOrg/lunarwing.git` before pulling updates.
4. **Port registry migration**: Existing multi-tenant deployments will auto-migrate the port registry from v4 to v5 on the next `add-tenant` or `ports list` call, renaming `reserved_3` to `weechat_adapter`. For standalone migration, run `ic/scripts/migrate-ports-v5.sh` as root.
5. **Pebble worker**: Tenants wanting Pebble support can run `configure-pebble <name> --nanogpt-api-key <key>` after building with `--with-pebble` to ensure real functionality.
6. **Multi-tenant onboarding**: Tenant provisioning now sets `ONBOARD_COMPLETED=true` to skip the setup wizard. Existing tenants that have already completed onboarding are unaffected (the TOML flag is still checked as a fallback).
