# Chaos Engineering Test Plan — LunarWing Self-Healing v2.0.0

*Drafted by Baud, 2026-06-10*

## 1. Scope

This test plan covers the **lunarwing-self-heal.sh** watchdog (v2.0.0) and its interaction with the `infrastructure-health-check.sh` report pipeline. It does **not** test the health-check probes themselves (separate concern) — only how the self-healer reacts to the reports those probes generate.

### Guardrails

- All tests run in **`--dry-run`** mode to avoid mutating live services.
- Each test uses a sandboxed temporary directory (`mktemp -d`) with synthetic:
  - `report.json` (health-check output)
  - `state.json` (pre-seeded or empty)
  - fake health-check scripts (e.g. `health-gateway.sh` that echo `{"status":"critical"}`)
- Assertions validate **stderr output**, **state.json mutations**, and **exit codes**.
- Tests extend `ic-infrastructure-health-check/tests/test-self-heal.sh`.

| C5 | Mixed init systems | systemd + openrc sub-units both unhealthy | Both targeted via their respective manager |
| C6 | Healthy sub-unit overrides logical degraded | Logical component degraded + init-system says healthy | **Not** remediated (init-system takes precedence) |

### D. Per-Tenant Systemd User Units

| ID | Scenario | Fault Inject | Expected Behavior |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| D1 | Tenant proxy degraded | Report marks `ironclaw-proxy-<tenant>` critical, registry has tenant user | `sudo -u <tenant> systemctl --user restart` |
| D2 | Tenant bridge degraded | Report marks `xmpp-bridge-<tenant>` critical, registry has tenant user | `sudo -u <tenant> systemctl --user restart` |
| D3 | Tenant user unknown | Report marks tenant service critical, no registry entry | Falls through to system `systemctl restart` |
| D4 | TENANTS_FILE missing | No ports.json on disk | Tenant resolution fails gracefully (no crash) |

### E. Grace Period

| ID | Scenario | Fault Inject | Expected Behavior |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| E1 | First observation (grace=2) | `consecutive_unhealthy=0` → 1 | `GRACE: 1/2`; no restart |
| E2 | Second observation (grace=2) | `consecutive_unhealthy=1` → 2 | Restart fires (grace met) |
| E3 | Single-check grace (grace=1) | First observation | Restart fires immediately |
| E4 | Healthy in between | unhealthy → healthy → unhealthy | Streak resets; new grace period |

### F. Backoff & Retry Spacing

| ID | Scenario | Fault Inject | Expected Behavior |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|

| F4 | Linear strategy | `--backoff-strategy linear` | Deterministic `next_attempt_at = base` |
| F5 | Attempt > 20 (overflow guard) | Pre-seeded `retries=25` | Capped to `BACKOFF_MAX` (3600), no loop blowup |
| F6 | Jitter uses urandom for large delays | `BACKOFF_MAX > 32767` | Uses `/dev/urandom`, not `$RANDOM` |
| F7 | Invalid attempt value | Non-numeric attempt | Returns 0, no crash |

## 4. Chaos Harness (Future)

Once the test matrix above is validated, the next step is a **chaos test runner** that:

1. **Injects faults** into a real environment (kill processes, block ports, corrupt config, fill disk)
2. **Runs health-check** to produce the report
3. **Runs self-heal** (non-dry-run) and captures the outcome
4. **Verifies recovery**: service active, health-check passes
5. **Verifies no collateral damage**: other services unaffected
6. **Scores**: pass/fail with timing metrics

### Initial Chaos Scenarios

| ID | Fault | Recovery Criterion | Max Recovery Time |
|----|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| C1 | `kill` gateway process | Gateway restarts and responds | 30s |
| C2 | Block HTTP port (gateway) | Process restarts, port rebinds | 30s |
| C3 | `kill` xmpp-bridge | Bridge restarts | 30s |
| C4 | `kill` TensorZero gateway | TensorZero restarts | 30s |
| C5 | ClickHouse crash | ClickHouse restarts | 60s |
| C6 | Corrupt env file (missing key) | Grace period → escalation (not auto-recoverable) | 2x grace checks |
| C7 | DNS failure | Services degrade, escalation after retries | 3x backoff cycle |
| C8 | Disk full (tmp) | State write fails, graceful degradation | N/A (escalation) |
| C9 | Port conflict (two services on same port) | First fails, escalation | 2x grace + retries |
| C10 | Tenant service crash | Tenant user-unit restarts | 30s |
| C11 | Tenant service crash (other tenants healthy) | Only affected tenant remediated | 30s |
| C12 | Rapid flapping (kill-loop) | Flap detection → escalation, no endless loop | 1x flap window |
| C13 | Transient blip (1s hiccup) | No restart (grace period absorbs) | N/A |

---

## 5. Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit-level (current)
- Extend `test-self-heal.sh` with matrix tests A–N above
- All run in dry-run with synthetic reports
- **Target**: >40 passing tests — **met** (~115 assertions in `test-self-heal-matrix.sh`, plus the 28 regression checks in `test-self-heal.sh`)

### Phase 2: Integration
- Run self-heal against real containers with controlled faults
- Verify end-to-end: health-check → report → self-heal → recovery
- **Target**: All chaos scenarios C1–C13 pass

### Phase 3: Multi-tenant
- Spin up 2+ tenants, inject faults independently
- Verify blast-radius isolation
- **Target**: C11 specifically validates no cross-tenant remediation

---

## 6. Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Unit tests passing | 40+ |
| False positive rate | 0 (grace period + init-system verification) |
| Recovery time (single service) | <30s |
| Flapping detection | No more than `FLAP_MAX_RESTARTS` in window |
| No collateral damage | Adjacent services untouched during remediation |
| Escalation reliability | Notification sent on max retries |

## 8. Implementation Status (2026-06-13)

The suite lives in `ic-infrastructure-health-check/tests/`:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `lib.sh` | Shared harness: assertions, sandbox, synthetic reports, a pure-function harness (`src_fn`), and a **mock init system** (fake `systemctl`/`rc-service`/`sudo` + component health checks driven by `svcstate/` files). |
| `test-self-heal.sh` | Original regression suite (28 checks). Left as-is. |
| `test-self-heal-matrix.sh` | Phase 1 matrix A1–N3 (~115 assertions), all dry-run. |
| `chaos-harness.sh` | Phase 2/3 end-to-end (CH1–CH13): real (non-dry) self-heal driven against the mock init system. |
| `run-all.sh` | Aggregates the three suites with a per-suite tally. |

```bash
cd ic-infrastructure-health-check
bash tests/run-all.sh                  # everything
bash tests/run-all.sh matrix           # just the unit matrix
bash tests/chaos-harness.sh            # just the chaos scenarios
```

**Safety model.** The matrix is dry-run only and never invokes the real
component health probes (verify is forced with fake `health-*.sh` fixtures); the
only real command it can reach is a read-only `systemctl is-active`. The chaos
harness runs self-heal *for real* but against the mock init system on `PATH`, so
a "restart" flips a sandbox file rather than touching a unit; escalation runs the
real `send-notification.sh` with an empty `GOTIFY_TOKEN`, so it short-circuits
before any network call. Both are safe on a dev box, but prefer a dedicated test
machine over a live multi-tenant host.

**Divergences from the original matrix (intentional):**

- **C5 (mixed init systems):** a host runs a single init manager, and the report
  only carries that manager's sub-unit block, so "mixed" is modeled as *several
  sub-units under the active manager*, each remediated via its manager.
- **C6 (init-system precedence):** the original expected a healthy init sub-unit
  to suppress a degraded *logical* component. In the current script the logical
  service key (`lunarwing`) and the init-unit key (`lunarwing.service`) differ,
  so there is **no cross-suppression** — the logical degrade is still remediated
  and the healthy init unit is left alone. The test asserts this real behavior.
  (The genuine "report says healthy → clear" path is exercised by K1/CH13.)
- **J1 (restart command fails):** cannot be reached in dry-run (dry-run restarts
  never fail), so it is validated end-to-end in `chaos-harness.sh` (CH9).
- **CH7 (DNS failure)** is modeled by CH6's stuck-service escalation path.
- **CH8 (disk full)** needs real disk-fault injection and is left for the
  integration test machine.

**Script follow-up surfaced by the tests (not yet changed):** `find_latest_report`
pipes `find … | xargs ls -t`. With no matches, GNU `xargs` still runs `ls -t`
against the *current directory*, so a stray file in CWD can be mistaken for "the
report" instead of dying cleanly. Consider `find … -print0 | xargs -0r ls -t` (or
`… | sort | tail -1`). The A1/A3 tests pin the intended no-report behavior by
running from an empty CWD.
