# Worker Container Healthcheck Port Mismatch (nanocode + pebble)

#### other improvement possible

**Status:** Resolved (2026-06-14) — **Option 2** applied to both workers (`HEALTH_PORT="0"` → `"8443"`).
**Severity:** Low (cosmetic) — workers are fully functional; the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` reported a false `unhealthy`.
**Scope:** Every tenant's `lunarwing-nanocode-<name>` and `lunarwing-pebble-<name>` container created by `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh`.

## TL;DR

The MT admin script starts both worker containers with `-e HEALTH_PORT="0"`, which moves (effectively disables) the in-container health HTTP server. But the worker images bake in a `HEALTHCHECK` that probes a fixed `http://127.0.0.1:8443/health`. The probe therefore always fails and the container settles into `unhealthy`, even though the WebSocket bridge the daemon actually talks to is up and serving. Fix: either disable the now-stale healthcheck (`--no-healthcheck`) or point the in-container health server back at the port the healthcheck expects (`HEALTH_PORT=8443`, unpublished).

## Symptom

After `start-tenant eris`, both workers report `unhealthy` while their WS ports listen normally:

```
$ docker ps --filter name=eris --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
lunarwing-pebble-eris     Up 2 minutes (unhealthy)
lunarwing-nanocode-eris   Up 2 minutes (unhealthy)
lunarwing-pg-eris         Up 30 minutes

$ docker inspect lunarwing-pebble-eris --format '{{json .State.Health.Log}}' | jq '.[-1]'
exit=1   output: ""        # curl to :8443 returns nothing — connection refused
```

Worker logs show the bridges are actually healthy (WS ports 10047/10048 listening, auth enabled):

```
[pebble4lunarwing] ws=0.0.0.0:10048/ws/agent health=:0 auth=enabled
[bridge] listening on ws://0.0.0.0:10048/ws/agent
[health] listening on http://0.0.0.0:0          # <- health server bound to port 0, not 8443

[bridge] server listening on ws://0.0.0.0:10047/ws/agent
[bridge] subprotocol: ironclaw-agent-v1
```

## Root cause

The image and the launcher disagree on the health port.

**Images hardcode the probe at 8443:**

- `pebble4lunarwing/Dockerfile:32` — `ENV HEALTH_PORT=8443`
- `pebble4lunarwing/Dockerfile:37-38`
  ```dockerfile
  HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=30s --retries=3 \
      CMD curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8443/health || exit 1
  ```
- `lunarcode4lunarwing/Dockerfile:161-162` — identical `HEALTHCHECK` probing `127.0.0.1:8443/health`

**The launcher overrides the port to 0:**

- `ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh:1210` (`start_tenant_nanocode`) — `-e HEALTH_PORT="0" \`
- `ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh:1294` (`start_tenant_pebble`) — `-e HEALTH_PORT="0" \`

The pebble bridge reads this directly: `pebble4lunarwing/src/bridge.rs:35` (`health_port: env_or("HEALTH_PORT", "8443")...`) and binds `0.0.0.0:health_port` in `src/main.rs:36`. With `HEALTH_PORT=0` the `/health` route (`src/health.rs:84`) is no longer reachable at 8443, so the in-container `curl` gets connection-refused → `exit 1` → after `retries=3`, `unhealthy`.

No host port is published for health, but that is irrelevant: a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` `CMD` runs **inside** the container's network namespace, so it only needs the server bound to `127.0.0.1:8443` *within* the container — not on the host, and not in the tenant's 10-port block.

## Impact

- **Functional:** none. `--restart unless-stopped` does **not** restart on health status (only on exit/crash), so there is no flap loop. `create_job(mode: "nanocode"|"pebble")` works because the daemon dials the WS bridge (10047/10048), which is up.
- **Operational:** misleading `unhealthy` in `docker ps` and `mt-admin.sh status`; noise for operators; and any health tooling that keys off Docker health (the infra health-check suite / self-heal work in `SELF_HEALING_IMPROVEMENTS_2.md`) will misreport these containers. Also breaks any future `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` wiring.

## Proposed fix

Both options are one-line edits to the two `docker run` blocks in `lunarwing-mt-admin.sh`. Pick one and apply it to **both** `start_tenant_nanocode` and `start_tenant_pebble`.

### Option 1 — Disable the stale healthcheck (recommended; universal)

Add `--no-healthcheck` to each `docker run`. Works for both worker types regardless of whether their bridge serves `/health`, and removes the false signal immediately.

```diff
       --restart unless-stopped \
+      --no-healthcheck \
       lunarwing-worker-nanocode:latest \
       --mode websocket >/dev/null
```
```diff
       --restart unless-stopped \
+      --no-healthcheck \
       lunarwing-worker-pebble:latest >/dev/null
```

Trade-off: no Docker-level liveness signal. Acceptable because nothing currently consumes it, and liveness is better observed via the WS bridge anyway.

### Option 2 — Re-enable the in-container health server (better observability)

Point the health server at the port the image already probes by changing `0` → `8443` (no `-p` publish needed; the check is in-container):

```diff
-      -e HEALTH_PORT="0" \
+      -e HEALTH_PORT="8443" \
```

- **pebble:** confirmed wired — `bridge.rs` reads `HEALTH_PORT`, `health.rs:84` serves `/health`. This will turn the container `healthy`.
- **nanocode:** **verify first.** No `/health` handler exists in `lunarcode4lunarwing/`'s Rust sources; its bridge differs (it fronts an `opencode` server on :4096). If its health server does not serve `/health` on `HEALTH_PORT`, this option won't fix nanocode — fall back to Option 1 for that worker.

In-container `8443` is safe across tenants because each container has its own network namespace (no host-level conflict).

### Recommendation (superseded — see Resolution)

The original recommendation was to ship **Option 1** for both now and pursue **Option 2** later. On
inspection (below), **Option 2 turned out to work for both workers**, so it shipped directly — it
resolves the symptom *and* restores a real liveness signal, which Option 1 cannot.

## Resolution

`start_tenant_nanocode` and `start_tenant_pebble` now launch with `-e HEALTH_PORT="8443"` (was
`"0"`), matching the port the images' baked `HEALTHCHECK` probes. No host port is published — the
probe runs inside the container's own network namespace, so `8443` is safe across tenants. This
answers open question #2: `HEALTH_PORT=0` was an unnecessary override (likely a perceived
host-port-conflict concern that doesn't apply to an in-container probe).

**Both health servers serve `/health` and honour `HEALTH_PORT`** (verified, resolving open
question #1):

- **pebble** — `src/bridge.rs` reads `HEALTH_PORT`, `src/main.rs:36` binds `0.0.0.0:<port>`,
  `src/health.rs` returns `200 {"status":"ok",…}` on `/health`.
- **nanocode** — `entrypoint.sh:15,97` launches `python3 health_server.py --port "$HEALTH_PORT"`,
  and `health_server.py` returns `200 {"status":"ok",…}` on `/health` (confirmed by running it
  directly: `curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:<port>/health` → exit 0). The bridge fronting `opencode` on
  `:4096` is unrelated to the health server, which is a standalone process.

Net effect: both containers now report `healthy` instead of `unhealthy`, and Docker-health-based
tooling (infra health-check suite, future `depends_on: service_healthy`) reads a true signal.

## Applying to already-running tenants

A container's healthcheck/env are immutable once created — editing the script alone does not fix running containers. After patching the script, recreate the worker containers:

```bash
sudo /home/sun/lw_new_workspace/lunarwing/ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh stop-tenant <name>
sudo /home/sun/lw_new_workspace/lunarwing/ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh start-tenant <name>
```

`start_tenant_{nanocode,pebble}` only re-creates a container when one does not already exist, and `stop-tenant` stops but does not remove it — so a hard recreate may be needed:

```bash
docker rm -f lunarwing-nanocode-<name> lunarwing-pebble-<name>
sudo /home/sun/lw_new_workspace/lunarwing/ic/scripts/lunarwing-mt-admin.sh start-tenant <name>
```

(Worker workspaces are bind-mounted from the tenant home, so removing the container is non-destructive.)

## Verification

```bash
# Option 1: containers should report no health status (just "Up"), not "unhealthy"
docker ps --filter name=<name> --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'

# Option 2 (pebble): exec the same probe the HEALTHCHECK runs
docker exec lunarwing-pebble-<name> curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8443/health && echo OK
```

## Affected tenants

All tenants with worker containers. Observed on `eris` (2026-06-13). `noko`, `ono`, `cumulus`, `nimbus` will exhibit the same if/when their nanocode/pebble containers are created.

## Resolved questions

1. **Does the nanocode bridge expose `/health` on `HEALTH_PORT`?** Yes — `health_server.py` serves `/health` (200) and `entrypoint.sh` launches it with `--port "$HEALTH_PORT"`. Option 2 works for nanocode.
2. **Was `HEALTH_PORT=0` deliberate?** Treated as an over-cautious override; the in-container probe needs no host port, so `8443` is safe and conflict-free across tenants.
3. **Should the working healthcheck feed infra health-check / self-heal tooling?** _(Still open.)_ Docker health is now truthful, so it *can* be consumed; whether it becomes the canonical worker liveness check vs. the WS-bridge probe is left to the self-heal work (`SELF_HEALING_IMPROVEMENTS_2.md`).
